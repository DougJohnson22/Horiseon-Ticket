# Horiseon-Ticket
Hello Horiseon!

Thank you for entrusting your website code with us. I was able clean up your code and add labels to all of the styling choices made for your website. 

Within your repo, you will see clear labels of each section of the html and css files. In addition to that, you will find the html code follow semantic guidelines in order to ensure that the Web Crawlers will be able to interpret your site and increase your rankings. Each image now has alt text to describe the visuals for accesibility and SEO purposes.
